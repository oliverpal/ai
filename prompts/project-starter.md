# Revised Prompt Template: From Idea to Production Flow for Angular Application

**Project Goal:** To define, design, develop, test, and deploy an Angular application based on research into `[Project Topic]`, specifically tailored for the development of angular application, including stakeholder feedback and post-launch considerations.

**Instructions:** Execute the following steps sequentially. Replace `[Project Topic]` with the specific subject of the project. Ensure all technical constraints (Angular 19.2.4+, Standalone Components, NgRx SignalStore, Data Services with HttpClient/HttpResource, Vitest, Playwright) are considered where relevant, especially from Step 2 onwards.

## Phase 1: Planning & Design

### Step 1: Domain Research & Context Definition

* **Role:** Domain expert
* **Objective:** Understand the `[Project Topic]` thoroughly from the perspective of a Domain expert, Client, focusing on their problems, goals, workflows, and information needs relevant to a potential software solution.
* **Actions:**
    1.  Conduct web research on `[Project Topic]`.
    2.  **Focus:** Identify key concepts, common challenges, existing solutions (if any), relevant regulations or standards, typical data points, and workflows pertinent to a Domain expert interacting with this topic.
    3.  **Synthesize:** Create a summary document (`1_Research_Summary.md`) outlining these findings. Clearly state the implications for a software solution â€“ what problems could it solve? What information must it manage/display?
    4.  **Curate Links:** Compile a list of authoritative/official sources and highly relevant links (`1_Relevant_Links.md`).
    5.  **(Optional) Visualize Complexity:** If the topic involves complex relationships, processes, or systems, create Mermaid diagrams (`1_Domain_Diagram.md` or embedded in the summary) to illustrate these concepts visually.
* **Deliverables:**
    * `1_Research_Summary.md`
    * `1_Relevant_Links.md`
    * `1_Domain_Diagram.md` (Optional, or embedded)
