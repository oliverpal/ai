# From Idea to Production Flow for Angular Application

**Project Goal:** To define, design, develop, test, and deploy an Angular application based on research into `[Project Topic]`, including research presentation, stakeholder feedback, and post-launch considerations.

**Instructions:** Execute the following steps sequentially. Replace `[Project Topic]` with the specific subject of the project. Ensure all technical constraints (Angular 19.2.4+, Standalone Components, NgRx SignalStore, Data Services with HttpClient/HttpResource, Vitest, Playwright) are considered where relevant, especially from Step 2 onwards.

## Phase 1: Planning & Design

### Step 1: Domain Research & Context Definition

* **Role:** Domain expert
* **Objective:** Understand the `[Project Topic]` thoroughly from the perspective of a Domain expert, Client, focusing on their problems, goals, workflows, and information needs relevant to a potential software solution.
* **Actions:**
    1.  Conduct web research on `[Project Topic]`.
    2.  **Focus:** Identify key concepts, common challenges, existing solutions (if any), relevant regulations or standards, typical data points, and workflows pertinent to a Domain expert interacting with this topic.
    3.  **Synthesize:** Create a summary document (`1_Research_Summary.md`) outlining these findings. Clearly state the implications for a software solution â€“ what problems could it solve? What information must it manage/display?
    4.  **Curate Links:** Compile a list of authoritative/official sources and highly relevant links (`1_Relevant_Links.md`).
    5.  **(Optional) Visualize Complexity:** If the topic involves complex relationships, processes, or systems, create Mermaid diagrams (`1_Domain_Diagram.md` or embedded in the summary) to illustrate these concepts visually.
* **Deliverables:**
    * `1_Research_Summary.md`
    * `1_Relevant_Links.md`
    * `1_Domain_Diagram.md` (Optional, or embedded)

### Step 1.5: Research Presentation Creation

* **Role:** Domain Expert / Analyst / Presenter
* **Objective:** To synthesize key research findings into a clear presentation format (using Markdown) suitable for communicating the problem space, opportunities, and initial ideas to stakeholders.
* **Actions:**
    1.  **Outline Presentation:** Based on `1_Research_Summary.md`, define the presentation structure and key messages (e.g., Intro, Problem, Findings, Gaps, Opportunity, Next Steps).
    2.  **Write Presentation Markdown:** Create a Markdown file (`1.5_Presentation.md`) using syntax compatible with a chosen presentation tool (e.g., Marp, Reveal.js via Markdown). Use slide separators (e.g., `---`), headings for titles, lists, images, etc. Include speaker notes if needed (syntax depends on the tool).
    3.  **Generate HTML Presentation:** Use reveal.js to convert the Markdown into a shareable HTML/CSS/JS presentation file (`1.5_Presentation.html`). Add nice, simple and elegant styling
    4.  **Prepare Pitch:** Refine the narrative for delivering the presentation.
* **Deliverables:**
    * `1.5_Presentation.md` (Source Markdown)
    * `1.5_Presentation.html` (Generated web-based presentation - Recommended)

### Step 2: Product Requirements & Initial Technical Concept

* **Role:** Domain expert and Angular architect
* **Objective:** Translate research findings (potentially informed by presentation feedback) into functional software requirements and outline a high-level technical approach.
* **Actions:** *(Contents remain the same, but inputs now include insights from Step 1 and potentially Step 1.5)*
    1.  **Define Requirements:** Based on `1_Research_Summary.md` and insights from Step 1.5, create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) (`2_PRD.md`). Include:
        * Introduction: Brief overview and goals.
        * User Personas.
        * Key Features / User Stories.
        * Data Requirements.
        * Non-Functional Requirements (Performance, Security, Usability).
        * Technical Stack Summary (Angular 19.2.4+, Standalone, SignalStore, HttpClient/HttpResource).
    2.  **Outline App Concept:** Create an application concept document (`2_App_Concept.md`). Include:
        * High-Level Features Map (linking features to potential screens).
        * Proposed Folder Structure.
        * Initial Component List (structural/feature level).
        * State Management Sketch (what SignalStore will manage).
        * Data Service Strategy.
* **Deliverables:**
    * `2_PRD.md`

### Step 3: Stakeholder Review & Concept Refinement

* **Role:** Product Owner / Project Manager (presenting), Key Stakeholders (Client, End-Users, Domain Experts, Technical Leads)
* **Objective:** Validate the defined requirements (`2_PRD.md`) and high-level technical concept (`2_App_Concept.md`) with stakeholders to ensure alignment and gather crucial feedback before proceeding. (The presentation from Step 1.5 may have already occurred, setting context).
* **Actions:**
    1.  **Present:** Share and walk through `2_PRD.md` and `2_App_Concept.md` with stakeholders.
    2.  **Gather Feedback:** Facilitate discussion and collect feedback on:
        * Accuracy and completeness of requirements.
        * Alignment with business goals and user needs.
        * Feasibility and appropriateness of the proposed technical approach.
        * Overall understanding of the application's scope and direction.
    3.  **Document:** Summarize the feedback and decisions made in `3_Feedback_Summary.md`.
    4.  **Refine:** Update `2_PRD.md` and `2_App_Concept.md` based on the agreed-upon feedback.
* **Deliverables:**
    * Updated `2_PRD.md`
    * Updated `2_App_Concept.md`
    * `3_Feedback_Summary.md` *(Renumbered filename)*

* **Actions:**
    1.  **Map User Flows:** Based on the updated `2_PRD.md`, define major user interaction flows in `4_UX_Flows.md` (using lists, descriptions, and Mermaid diagrams for key flows).
    2.  **Identify UI Components:** List reusable UI elements needed across the application in `4_UI_Component_List.md` (atomic/molecular level: buttons, inputs, tables, cards, modals, etc.).
* **Deliverables:**
    * `4_UX_Flows.md` (including embedded Mermaid diagrams) *(Renumbered filename)*
    * `4_UI_Component_List.md` *(Renumbered filename)*

### Step 5: Task Breakdown & Acceptance Criteria

* **Role:** Product owner / Project Manager / Lead Developer
* **Objective:** Break down the development work into manageable tasks based on the refined requirements, concept, and UX flows, with clear completion criteria.
* **Actions:**
    1.  **Define Tasks:** Create a list of specific, actionable development tasks in `5_Implementation_Tasks.md`, grouped logically (by feature, component, etc.). Reference PRD, App Concept, UX Flows.
    2.  **Define Acceptance Criteria:** For each major task or feature, write clear, testable acceptance criteria confirming successful completion.
* **Deliverables:**
    * `5_Implementation_Tasks.md` *(Renumbered filename)*

### Step 6: UI Mockups (HTML/CSS - Static)

* **Role:** Frontend developer / UI Designer
* **Objective:** Create static, responsive HTML and CSS mockups for core layouts and key screens based on UX flows and UI components, facilitating easy translation to Angular.
* **Actions:**
    1.  **Establish Basic Layout:** Create `layout.html` and `styles.css` for the main shell.
    2.  **Mock Key Screens:** Create separate HTML files (e.g., `dashboard.html`, `feature_list.html`).
    3.  **Apply Styling:** Use `styles.css` for consistent styling, layout, typography, color, spacing, implementing styles for components from `4_UI_Component_List.md`.
    4.  **Prioritize Cleanliness & Migration:** Use semantic HTML and clear CSS conventions (like BEM).
    5.  **Responsiveness:** Ensure mockups adapt to different screen sizes.
    6.  **Minimal JS:** Use `scripts.js` *only* for basic UI interactions needed in the mockup (e.g., toggles).
* **Deliverables:**
    * A folder named `6_UI_Mocks/` containing HTML, CSS, minimal JS, and optional assets. *(Renumbered folder name)*
